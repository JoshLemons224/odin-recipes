        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These delicious chocolate cookies taste like brownies. They're crisp on the outside, soft, and fudgy on the inside.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>   
            <ul><li> Sugar: This chocolate cookie recipe starts with two cups of white sugar.</li>
                <li>  Margarine: This top-rated recipe calls for margarine, but you can use butter if you prefer.</li>
                <li>  Eggs: Two eggs lend moisture and help bind the cookie dough together.</li>
                <li> Vanilla: Vanilla extract gives the cookies an extra depth of flavor.</li>
                <li>  Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the chocolate cookie dough.</li>
                <li>  Cocoa powder: Unsweetened cocoa powder is the key to all that chocolatey goodness.</li>
                <li>  Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
                    <li>  Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the cookies, but it won't make them taste salty.</li>
                    <li>  Nuts: Walnuts are optional, but they add a welcome crunch. You can use pecans if you prefer.</li></ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol><li>Cream the sugar and margarine, beat in the eggs, then add the vanilla.</li>
                <li>Combine the dry ingredients, then add the dry mixture to the wet mixture.</li>
                <li>Drop the dough by the spoonful onto cookie sheets and bake.</li>
                </ol>
